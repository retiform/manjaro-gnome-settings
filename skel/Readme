We have added a postlogin script to check if you use the autologin,
if you don't use this feature automatically, we removed the annoing issue of the double shell:
one is your user and other is gdm user ( zombie shell )
WARNING(!) the autologin not work with this applied
see here for more info.

If you don't want this simply remove this with :

sudo rm /etc/gdm/PostLogin/Default
